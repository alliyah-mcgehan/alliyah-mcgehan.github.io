        Neuroplasticity allows the brain to rewire itself in response to experience, which helps to
         increase its resilience. Learning a second language, adequate sleep, and memorization techniques 
         are examples of activities that may improve the neuroplasticity of your brain. Understanding the 
         principles of neuroplasticity helps people to cultivate its benefits. If they are able to 
         understand its principles they can implement them into their daily life and create positive changes 
         for their brain. The principle “intensity matters” is relevant to me during this programme. 
         Challenging tasks can lead to neuroplasticity and motor learning. JavaScript and all of its 
         different concepts definitely stimulate my mind. The principle “use it and improve it” is also 
         relevant to me because I need to stay consistent. Consistency will help me improve my skills and 
         hopefully trigger neuroplasticity.

         A growth mindset describes how a person views challenges and setbacks. A person with a growth 
         mindset believes that their abilities aren't fixed, despite any struggles that they face. It is
          important to have this mindset because it motivates people to take risks without the fear of 
          failing and boosts resilience. A person with this mindset can remain calm when they make mistakes, 
          because they know it's an opportunity to learn and grow. I will be using the new knowledge I have
          gained to stay consistent and motivated.
