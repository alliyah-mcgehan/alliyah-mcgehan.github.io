        My long term goal is to work a remote job that allows me to travel. My strengths are 
        seeking solutions online and attempting different methods until an issue is solved. My 
        limitations are my time management skills. I would like to develop the skill to communicate 
        under pressure. When I face challenges I will seek help from facilitators, my peers, or 
        online as soon as possible. The facilitation team is already very supportive and understanding. 
        Recently I have had some personal matters that I have been focused on but I understand that 
        I will need to put my full attention into the programme if I want to succeed. I don't have any 
        important block out times during the week. I try to go to the gym every second day but I am 
        able to go at any time of the day.
