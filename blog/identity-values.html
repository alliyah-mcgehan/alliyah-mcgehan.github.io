        At my previous job I became close with a coworker, who I later found out
        was taking small amounts of money/products from the company. Since I had
        already become close with the coworker it was difficult to decide on how
        to go about the situation but I knew what they were doing was wrong. I
        decided to talk to them about it first, instead of going straight to
        management, which may be questionable to some people. They assured me
        that they rarely did it and that it was fine but eventually other
        co-workers began to notice. I decided to go management and speak to them
        about the situation. The coworker doesn't resent me and I don't regret
        going to them first, instead of management. I do not regret it because I
        know that generally they are a good person but they had just made some
        mistakes. My mother is Filipino so we were raised on catholic beliefs
        and are very people oriented. This helps me get along with most people,
        which makes it easier to work in a team. My limitations are just my time
        management skills.
