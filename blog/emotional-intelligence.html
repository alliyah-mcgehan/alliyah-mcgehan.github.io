        Emotional intelligence (EQ) refers to a person's ability to understand
        their own emotions as well as the emotions of others around them. On the
        contrary intelligence quotient (IQ) refers to a person's mental and
        logical capability. The three steps of emotional intelligence are
        mindfulness, self knowledge/self mastery and mental habits. Practising
        mindfulness can be helpful for improving attention and compassion. Self
        knowledge is useful for recognising one's emotions and learning to
        regulate them. Useful mental habits can help defend against the superego
        (critical or judgmental thoughts). The main benefits of strengthening
        one's emotional intelligence are stellar performance, outstanding
        leadership and happiness. Stellar performance is shown through
        conceptual thinking, analytical ability, initiative and self confidence.
        Emotional intelligence is important for leadership because it involves a
        deeper understanding of others. Emotional intelligence is relevantin my
        life because it helps me to create deeper bonds and feelings of trust
        with others.

        I engaged in mindfulness and conscious listening with my dad. We
        discussed his past experiences and I related them to some of the
        experiences Iâ€™ve had.
